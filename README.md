### Framework

#### PSR Implementation
I wrote 2 frameworks that implement PSR interfaces.

They were built for learning purposes, so I think using them in production is a bad idea.
But you can still watch the source code (even if it's not updated to the latest PHP Version), and came up with new ideas.

I created organization to separate repositories, related to this project.

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/PSR-Framework">Organization</a></li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/PSR-Framework/skeleton">
            First version (my own components)
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/PSR-Framework/main-template">
            Second version (popular components)
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

### Libraries

At this moment, I have created 1 Vue library and 2 TypeScript libraries.
I also created TS template for creating libs.

They can be not very helpful and original, but creating them was very interesting experience.

In the future, I will think more about the usability.
Here is the list of them:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Arslanoov/vue-autocomplete">Vue autocomplete</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Arslanoov/virtual-keyboard">Virtual Keyboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Arslanoov/date-picker">Date picker</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Arslanoov/ts-library-template">Library template</a></li>
</ul>

### Laravel store project
In 2019, when I was 16 years old, I created store pet project in Laravel.
I asked one youtuber to review it, and he did it!

More than 2 years passed, and I have rethought the project structure and architecture a lot of times.
I don't care about the stars/likes, but repositories with stars attract some people :D

That's why I put it in the dashboard page, and mentioned here.

### Admin panel
This project might be the most useful in this list, because I created it for purpose.

I created in very short time (few days), so I didn't use complicated architecture.
This admin panel allows you to set up and control the server for the very popular game without any programming knowledge.

I also used <a href="https://github.com/PSR-Framework/skeleton">my own framework</a> to create this project.

I am a very lazy and busy man, and also I don't play games anymore,
that's why I abandoned it a little (but you can fork it and maintain, of course :)).
